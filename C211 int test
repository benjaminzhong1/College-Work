//output is "(1/3) * 3 is equal to 0" because number is initialized as an integer it is a whole number and no decimals are allowed/decimals or fractions are converted to 0 so it would still spit out that number = 0 in the cout line

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  //int can only be a whole number not a fraction
  int number = (1/3) * 3;
  cout << "(1/3) * 3 is equal to " << number;

  return 0;
}
